# Project GomokuPro Machine Learning Model

In this paper, the author propose a machine learning Gomoku model, GomokuPro, which is based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) as well as Monte Carlo Tree Search. I turned the more multi-dimensional score model into an adaptive model based on a single machine learning strategy that I had previously developed and was able to make judgments and predictions based on the following human algorithm. Although this algorithm has significantly reduced the computational effort, it still does not provide robust performance in some cases. The computational effort of convolutional neural networks is also affected by the type of data. However, most of the time, the machine learning models are still able to make master predictions.
